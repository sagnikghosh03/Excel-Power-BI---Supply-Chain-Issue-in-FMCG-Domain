Supply Chain Analytics Project - AtliQ Mart
Overview:

Dive into my Supply Chain Analytics Project for AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer in Gujarat, India! This project showcases my data analysis expertise, leveraging Excel for in-depth analysis and transitioning to Power BI for impactful visualization. My goal? Optimize AtliQ Mart's supply chain operations.

Key Features:

Excel-Powered Insights:
Utilized advanced Excel features like pivot tables and conditional formatting to analyze "Line Fill Rate" and "Volume Fill Rate."
Uncovered crucial insights into order quantities, undelivered orders, and product-specific delivery delays.
Seamless Power BI Transition:
Recognizing Excel's limitations for comprehensive dashboards, I transitioned to Power BI for enhanced visualization and interactivity.
Developed a dynamic dashboard allowing stakeholders to explore metrics, drill down into performance across time, cities, and customers.
Granular Analysis:
Excel analysis revealed Vadodara city's high order quantity alongside the highest undelivered order percentage (3.63%).
Identified product-specific optimization opportunities for products like AM Curd 100 and AM Ghee 100.
Key Findings:

Despite having the most orders, Vadodara showcased the highest undelivered order percentage (3.63%).
Surat boasted the highest "On Time In Full" (OTIF) percentage (30.1%), while Vadodara had the lowest (27.8%).
Top-performing customers and their specific needs were identified for targeted service improvements.
Average order fulfillment times were 2 days after the agreed delivery date, with a maximum delay of 3 days.
Products with the highest average delivery delays were pinpointed for optimization.
Benefits:

This project offers valuable insights for AtliQ Mart to optimize their supply chain, including:

Identifying areas for improvement in delivery performance across cities and customers.
Prioritizing product-specific strategies based on delivery delays.
Tailoring service based on top-performing customer needs.
Establishing data-driven decision-making for supply chain operations.
I invite you to explore the project and discover the full potential of data-driven insights for supply chain optimization!
